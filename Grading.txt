You properly divided up the two operands into whole, numerator, and denominator, but
you were not finding the operand properly, so no math was ever being done.  You also
did not handle the "quit" input properly.

Because you were not finding the operand, no math was ever even being attempted.  Every
question returned "zero", which incidentally did match some of the test answers, but not
because accurate math was being done.

I fixed your operand issue, and found that you had an open bracket that was causing large
sections of your code to be skipped.  I fixed that issue, and then I was able to get some
calculations to be attempted, and some were correct, but many were still very wrong.

The ones that were correct were reduced properly... it appears you put a fair amount of work
into that.  But, they were not presented properly as simplified mixed numbers.
